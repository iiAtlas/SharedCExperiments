A shared C program filled with various experiments

Rules:
	1. Don't hang program excecution without warning
	2. Provide a way to break out of any infinite loop
	3. Comment your code heavilly
	4. Be smart and safe, don't crash the program
	5. If you're going to make a global variable, don't use a generic name
	6. No anonymous functions, always write function prototypes

Have fun, and good luck!
